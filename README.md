## **1. Fork the Repository and Pull Updates**

### **Steps to Fork**
1. Navigate to the [Sample MERN with Microservices Repository](https://github.com/UnpredictablePrashant/SampleMERNwithMicroservices).
2. Click "Fork" to create a copy under your account.
3. Clone the forked repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/SampleMERNwithMicroservices.git
   ```
   
---

## **2. Set Up the AWS Environment**

- Install AWS CLI and configure it with your credentials.
- Install Python and the Boto3 library for programmatically managing AWS resources.

---

## **3. Prepare the MERN Application**

- Create `Dockerfile` for both backend and frontend services to containerize the application.
  ```bash
  # Dockerfile for Frontend

  FROM node:14
  WORKDIR /app
  COPY package*.json ./
  RUN npm install
  COPY . .
  CMD ["npm", "start"]
  EXPOSE 3000

  ```

  ```bash
  # Dockerfile for Backend
  
 FROM node:14
 WORKDIR /app
 COPY package*.json ./
 RUN npm install
 COPY . .
 CMD ["npm", "start"]
 EXPOSE 5000

  ```

- Build Docker images and push them to Amazon ECR.

---

## **4. Version Control with AWS CodeCommit**

- Create a CodeCommit repository and push your application code to it for version control.

---

## **5. Continuous Integration with Jenkins**

- Install Jenkins on an EC2 instance.
- Create Jenkins pipeline jobs to build Docker images and push them to Amazon ECR.

---

## **6. Infrastructure as Code with Boto3**

- Use Python and Boto3 to define and provision AWS resources like VPC, subnets, security groups, and Auto Scaling Groups programmatically.

---

## **7. Networking and Deployment**

- Set up an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) for traffic distribution.
- Configure Route 53 for DNS routing.
- Deploy the frontend and backend services on EC2 instances.

---

## **8. Kubernetes Deployment**

- Use `eksctl` to create an Amazon EKS cluster.
- Deploy the MERN application on Kubernetes using Helm charts.

---

## **9. Monitoring and Logging**

- Enable CloudWatch to monitor application performance and maintain centralized logging.
- Configure alarms to ensure application health.

---

## **10. Final Documentation**

- Document the entire process, including configurations and architecture, and publish it on GitHub for future reference.
